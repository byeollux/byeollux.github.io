FINALLY, my first first-author paper which is based on my first project with Wani is published today in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn8616"><i>Science Advances</i></a> with the title of <i>When self comes to wandering mind: Brain representations and dynamics of self-generated concepts in spontaneous thought</i>. This study d a newly developed task-the Free Association Semantic Task (FAST) for a deeper understanding of self-generated thought. At last, this study demonstrates that where in the brain self-generated, endogenous thoughts are represented and how self-relevance modulates the brainâ€™s affective representations.

This project has special meaning to me as it was the first project I took charge of after I graduated from undergraduate and joined Wani's lab in 2017. Wani, Jessica, and I started designing experiments in 2017 Fall. I wasn't good at Matlab at that time and I learned how to use the Psychtoolbox to make experimental scripts, how to run the MRI scanner, Matlab codes, and how to operate Biopac and Eyelink eye tracker. With the experimental codes and fMRI experimental settings made in that way, I completed the 100 fMRI scan sessions that lasted 2.5 hours with Minie Jung and Jinwon Park, the research assistants who helped me conduct the experiment from the 2017 Winter to the 2018 Spring .
It was only the beginning, and there have been numerous analyses and writing over the years since then. Eventually, I am very proud and honored to publish it in <i>Science Advances</i>. I'm very grateful to Wani for giving the opportunity to lead this wonderful project to me and guiding me patiently from scratch. Also, thanks to our awesome co-authors, this paper has been transformed into much better work. I'm very lucky to have this amazing research team.
