I'm over the moon to post that I've got the official offer from <a href="http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Dartmouth Psychological and Brain Sciences</b></a> Ph.D. program! ðŸ¥³ 
I sent my acceptance response right away. 

I'm very exciting to join in the awesome PBS team and <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/canlab/" target="_blank"><b>Dr. Tor Wager's Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab</b></a>. I've been familiar with Tor's mind-blowing work over the years and working with him has long been one of my dream in career. Besides, many top-notch faculty members, including Tor Wager, Emily Finn, Mark Thornton and so on, who are pushing the limits of the affective, social, and computational neuroscience recently joined Dartmouth PBS. Through the official interview and interactions with PBS current students, I could feel that Dartmouth is a very research-oriented place. These parts were the key reasons I decided to join this place. I am so looking forward to see what research comes out here and how I can contribute to the PBS over the next 5-6 years. I will be a Tor's neurotree-kid as well as neurotree-granddaughter (cause my current advisor Wani got his Ph.D. under Tor's supervision). ðŸ˜‚ Also, my dream come true thanks to many people's support from Wani, other collegues, friends, and my soul mate. ðŸ¥° I'll never forget their heartwarming encouragement.

I'm already starting to learn about life in the Upper Valley (year-round weather in New Hampshire, housing, tax system, water quality, health insurance, driver license, visa, and so on). ðŸ¤“ I'm so prepared to enjoy pleasant research with Dr. Tor in the beautiful Upper Valley!
